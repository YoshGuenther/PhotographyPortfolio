        <p>Meet Jason and Kat! I had the pleasure of taking maternity photos for this blessed couple.
        There baby boy is expected to arrive mid-May and their family couldn't be more excited.
        Even their dog, Kylie, wanted to get in on the action and have her photo taken.</p>

        <h3>Self Critique:</h3>
        <div id="self-critique">
            <h4>Lighting:</h4>
            <p>I started late into the Golden Hour, so the light was fading fast.
                As a result, you can clearly see the photos get darker as the shoot pogressed.
                Also, this caused the shoot be very short - it was under 30 minutes. I also
                could have used a reflector to remove facial shadows.</p>
            <h4>Focus:</h4>
            <p>I was in such a rush that I didn't look at my playback screen often enough to make
                sure I was getting the shots I wanted. As a result, there were several shots that
                were out of focus and had to be tossed. Additionally, I failed to capture Kat's
                beautiful brown eyes clearly in the photo where she is leaning backward in the wheel
                barrow, looking at the camera.</p>
            <h4>Creativity:</h4>
            <p>Since this was my first maternity shoot, and second portrait shoot overall, I feel that
                I did a good job of coming up with ideas on the spot. For some of them, I built off other
                ideas that I have seen before, such as the water hose. However, I also played on the personality
                of the couple. Jason is very goofy and enjoys working with his hands. After scavenging through his
                workshop, I came up with the idea to put Kat in a wheel barrow.</p>
